    <p>This website has detailed the components of a PC and how to assemble them, however, as PC building is such an expansive subject (there are millions of components and combinations) I have not fully explained every topic. Even leaving out components such as the disc drive and expansion cards, giving few examples.</p>
    <p>The reason why I made this website (other than the fact that I need to for an assessment) is because I enjoy PC building. Even though I have never actually build a PC, I believe I am qualified to choose and assemble them to some extent.</p>
